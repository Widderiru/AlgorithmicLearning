\section*{Exerise 1}
\subsection*{a)}
The VC-dimension is 3, because you can shatter all sets of size 3, but it is not
possible to shatter the set $\{+-+-\}$. Like to see in the following picture:

\subsection*{b)}

The VC-dimension is $\infty$, 

You construct the set as following:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item All numbers are constructed as product of prime numbers
  \item 
\end{enumerate}
\section*{Exercise 2}
The first observation is, the points have to be in a circle. Wouldn't they be in
a circle, there would always be a point in the middle, that destroys the
shattablilty. The points outside and the point in the middle would have to be of
the same ``classification''.

It is possible to sort 7 points such that they are shattable. Subsets of size 1
and 2 are trivial. All other combinations you can see on the picture.

If you try for 8 points this construction you will fail with a subset of 3. We
know because of the beginning, that they have to be in a ring organized. If you
have that than the following is a counterexample of a subset.
